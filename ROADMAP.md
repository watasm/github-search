# Roadmap

## Enhancements:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for the repository list to improve performance and user experience.
2. **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode for better accessibility and user preference.
3. **Modern Design**: Apply a modern and attractive design to the application. Use colors, fonts, icons, and animations that enhance the user interface and user experience.

## New Features:

1. **User Authentication**: Integrate with GitHub's OAuth service to allow users to authenticate and interact with their own repositories (e.g., starring a repo).
2. **Repository Sorting**: Allow users to sort repositories based on different criteria like stars, forks, open issues, and last updated date.
3. **Advanced Search**: Expand the search functionality to include filters (e.g., language, stars, forks).
4. **Repository Comparison**: Allow users to select multiple repositories and provide a side-by-side comparison.
5. **Contributors List**: In the RepositoryDetail component, show a list of top contributors.
6. **Issue Tracker**: Show open issues for each repository and allow users to filter and sort them.

## Testing & Documentation:

1. **Unit Tests**: Write more unit tests for components using libraries like Jest.
2. **Integration Tests**: Use testing libraries like Cypress for end-to-end testing.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using services like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
